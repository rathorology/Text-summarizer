Capterra___1584391,EchoSpan 360 Degree Feedback,"I am a fan!  EchoSpan has proven to be an ideal partner for our engagement surveys.  The staff are highly responsive and the communication on projects is unsurpassed.  These characteristics are not easy to find in many bigger technology companies.  Bigger is not always better.  EchoSpan is the smart choice for solid software functionality and 5 star customer service! Many software packages are ""over built"" for the functionality businesses actually need.  EchoSpan is one of the few companies who designs software that walks that line perfectly.  The basics are covered with an easy step-by-step process that is both intuitive and elegant. There are also advanced features like sentiment analysis to keep pace with market competitors. They've delivered the perfect balance of neither too much nor too little functionality in their software, which makes it particularly ideal for mid-market clients.  Additionally, I can't say enough about the professionalism of their project management team.  We outsourced a very high profile project to EchoSpan and I never experienced such seamless implementation, flexibility to change course when needed, and detailed communication to ensure decisions happened quickly.  Bravo EchoSpan! Honestly, I can't think of anything.  The reports are straightforward and easy to understand.  Some of the competitors have elegant data visualization dashboards but charge 2x the money for it.","echospan

Capterra___138744,EchoSpan 360 Degree Feedback,"I am a confirmed fan. I searched for months for a 360 survey solution that was capable, flexible, and affordable. I found a lot of capability and  flexibility out there. Affordability was another matter. Just to get started, I was being told by most vendors, would require $60,000 to $80,000 dollars. After that there's be an additional $60,000 in annual licensing fees.  For a survey that would be used regularly but on a limited basis this made no financial sense whatever. Then I came across Echospan. They saved my project. Ours is a special application of the usual 360 degree tool. We aren't using it as a competency survey for individuals. Instead, we have developed a team effectiveness assessment that runs on a 360 platform. Echospan works perfectly for our needs. It's simple, easy to set up and administer and cost effective. There are a few limitations especially in formatting of final reports. But, for the flexibility and at the cost I can't complain. ","effectiveness

First and foremost, the EchoSpan customer service has been amazing.  I never wait more than 2 hours for a response on any questions and they have helped me update, customize, and create multiple different reports for our program. 

The software is easy to use and navigate.  And the reports come out great + they are easy to customize to get what we need. I wish it was easier to customize without getting help (but then again, it's nice to pass along a request and have it done for us).","customize

I enjoy how intuitive it is to the user and how engaged glint is with it's own customer base, providing a lot of resources about performance management so we can make sure as employers that we are getting the most out of our employment.  What I like the most about Glint software is how protected my information is as a user between employer and employee. I like having the ability to give solid feedback in an arena where my identity can remain anonymous. This is a crucial aspect in being able to give constructive feedback in my work environment. The way that Glint software is set up and presented to me as an employer gives me the confidence to speak my honest truth knowing that the information I provide is confidential.

Capterra___531058,iRevü,This software helped in understanding what worked and what didn't for our employees. A lot of our employees don't earn a lot of money which is typical for the house cleaning industry. What we struggled with was finding ways to motivate them day to day. It wasn't bonuses or the potential for raises that incentivized them. More it was scheduling flexibility to be with kids and certainty in pay that mattered more. Knowing this allowed us to cut programs that didn't work and reduce overhead. Between the training and the support and how easy the tool has been adopted throughout our company has made huge improvements for us.

In addition the option to request feedback from anyone is a great asset to creating a culture of transparency and collaboration.

SoftwareAdvice___399534,Insights,"If you are looking for a paperless, clear, simple and transparent solution to employee engagement and evaluation process woes, look no further! Kids' Country has struggled with the formal evaluation process for many years.  Lack of time, an employee base that does not access technology regularly, and the disconnect between frontline staff and organizational initiatives are just some of the challenges we faced.  Once we completed our strategic planning process and determined that employee engagement, recruitment and retention were key opportunities for us, we began to look for an alternative to the formal process.  OpaConnect has been a dream come true.  The system has taken what used to be a scary, complicated and laborious process, and created what is now something our staff look forward to.  The system clearly makes the connection between front line staff's goals to our key strategic initiatives.  It also allows for more consistent and casual conversations regarding staff performance versus the dreaded annual meeting.  Employees are empowered to keep notes and tasks documented within Opa to talk about with their supervisors.  ""Shoutouts"" allow for anyone to celebrate colleagues for any reason.  The behind, on track or ahead rating is simple and easy to understand.  The transparency regarding goals and initiatives across all levels has also created a new found trust at Kids' Country.  The customer service support has been phenomenal.  I've provided quite a bit of feedback in the form of features that would be helpful and all of it has been heard, considered and much of it was implemented!

The best part for us is that we have constant contact with the support team and work very closely in designing processes and workflows to respond our internal needs. We are working on having a more horizontal structure and be able to install a collective decision making process. So far Cake HR needs for everyone to have a ""manager"" for approvals in many of the processes so sometimes we need to think around that.
This is not a mejor limitation since the app also allows for some processes to have automatic approvals, but would be interesting to evaluate new organization models.

There are a lot of functions to play around, and I find 90% of the functions applicable to the company, and would be applicable to other companies too.

Makes keeping track of employee's goals and tasks easier than ever, with notifications sent to certain individuals frequently yet not too much that they would consider it as spam.

Capterra___1009878,CakeHR,"The CakeHR, although with some issues, has quite the potential, especially if the developers continue improving and updating it. Not to mention that it is cheap in comparison to, for example, same BambooHR and it also fulfills pretty much all the needed options.  
I was pleasantly surprised with the customer support that I was provided while working with this software: if you have any questions or issues - the support team will always answer you within a day and try their best to adjust the software's settings to your liking and if you still have any further questions - they will arrange a meeting to help you solve the problem. 
The CakeHR is especially convenient for those companies that are functioning within one country. However, even if the company has several branches located in several countries it is still not a problem. Although it can be a bit confusing at first with all these access levels and settings that you will have to think about - with the right tags and teams you will manage it just fine.
 The Cake is very convenient for employees in terms of usage: it is simple, understandable, and solves the problem with the time-off policies' usage tracking.  There were quite a few issues that weren't particularly to my liking; however, after mentioning them to the CakeHR support team - they were quickly fixed and changed in the way we wanted them to.  Still, there is one thing that I think needs an improvement.

As of now, when you want to upload the documents - you cannot filter/restrict them by location or the team. You can either upload it for everyone within the company to see it or upload it individually. As you might have already realized from that - if you want only one department or only one country's branch to see a certain document - you will have to upload it individually every time. ","support

Capterra___1188063,Usersnap,"Overall, Usersnap has been a great tool to help us provide our customers with better support, but I wish it did more.  Their idea is simple and effective - it's a great way to get a quick snapshot from users to help troubleshoot issues or get feedback when working with users who may not be technologically-capable enough to know how to take a screenshot. Usersnap was a life saver for our company and helped us up our Customer Support game significantly. The interface is simple enough to figure out, and its integration with Intercom was perfect for our needs. The customization options to black out data was essential to for our HIPAA-compliant customers, and the attache JS console is perfect for quick debugging.  It seems like the tool has a lot of potential, but essentially it just does one thing: lets users take screenshots. (I know they have since introduced their CX product for customer satisfaction surveying, but we never upgraded to this option). Some things I found that would make this better was: the ability to take full-page screenshots, or a co-browsing/screensharing feature,  or have a more robust interface for us to be able to organize and categorize our screenshots better. It was useful for us at one point, but then we decided to switch over to a co-browsing tool instead because screenshots just weren't allowing us to provide the support we wanted. ","customers

Usersnap gives your customers and easy way to give you feedback about your website. It can be hard to explain via email your feedback about a visual thing such as a website.

Capterra___1442991,Usersnap,"I've trialed Usersnap two times now to consider it for use with our team, first within the full Usersnap reporting and reviewing ecosystem, and later as a reporting tool for Jira. The tool seems neat for basic purposes, but is fairly limited and pricey for large teams working on multiple projects.  I appreciated the tidy little on screen reporting widget that Usersnap Classic offers. The annotation tools, and label syncing with Jira is great.  When reporting issues or suggestions, the uploading of screenshots is slower than you'd like for power users. The Usersnap classic widget is neat, but the options for adjusting it to suit your projects are limited. 

You'll also find yourself limited when it comes to pricing and projects. The basic plans are fairly pricey and limited to running just a few projects at a time. This might be suitable for teams working on one or two in house websites, but doesn't work for web agencies with lots of clients. ","reporting

SoftwareAdvice___199945,Saba TalentSpace,"This past June we completed our migration from Saba SEC 5.5 to Saba Cloud.  The upgrade process itself was lengthy and at times a bit challenging, but in the end was a success and well worth it.

The migration took close to a year (from initial meetings to launch day), and because we were on such an old version of SEC which included customized reports, we found it a challenge to build new processes and functionality to accommodate existing business requirements, given that Saba Cloud doesn't allow for customizations.  In the end we chose to export the required data elements using Analytics, and build a separate external system to manage the data.

Saba cloud itself was well received by our internal stakeholders and end users.  The interface is much more intuitive and we didn't have much resistance or confusion with our staff in using the new system.

Also finally being able to properly integrate Single Sign on has been wonderful.
 Analytics tool is fantastic and much improved over our previous SEC 55 reporting system!  We heavily depend on it to run daily reporting and to export large chunks of data to an offsite system and it has been running quite smoothly.

Single Sign on (finally) Is a big plus.  

For our people administrators the ""Proxy user"" from people admin has been invaluable for troubleshooting.

The interface as a whole is a big improvement and has been well received by our clients. Coming from SEC 5.5. some things still appear to be the same, and still seem too confusing or clunky:
- Notification system is incredibly flexible, but very confusing to use and extremely time consuming to make changes to.  Especially when trying to manage two different locals (EN UK and French Canadian) - especially when these locals are not EN US.
- Completed Courses page:  the ""Load More"" at the bottom of the page is confusing. Even if ""Show all"" has been selected, the learner still needs to click ""Load More"" to view other transcripts.  Also sorting this list is very limited.  Our users have a large collection of courses and had heavily used the sorting features of this page in SEC 5.5

It's rare to feel like a vendor relationship really serves as part of your team, but the relationship with Halogen Software strengthens with time.  I am confident that their team will remain on the cutting edge of Talent Management, providing us with innovative solutions and exceptional customer service. We originally purchased a tool, but Halogen E-Appraisal has become a significant part of our culture.  The product is fully customizable to meet the ever changing needs of our firm.  It has provided consistency and accountability throughout our organization.  Halogen's team listens to their clients, making our success their primary goal.  Their customer support is superb and we continue to be amazed with the quality of each enhancement they roll out.  Originally viewed as an expense, our first year of implementation resulted in efficiencies of nearly 400 hours when measured against our prior paper process.  We now accomplish a higher quality of talent management with less time spent on administering the process.   Our employees view the previously dreaded appraisal process as an ""investment"" in their career and individual personal development plans ensure that each and every member of our team will receive the training and development necessary to accomplish their career goals. As a new user in 2004, there were limitations in the product based on the methodology our firm used for performance management.  Since that time, the product has met and surpassed my expectations, causing our leadership to stretch ourselves in this area.  We have more clear metrics and competencies for each role within the firm and the reporting tools allow us to see progress at all times.  We also needed the ability to have multiple roles for each employee and the recent addition of the ""coach"" will accomplish our objectives in this area.  Our firm has historically utilized a full 360 process and originally Halogen did not support the ability to conduct such a process anomymously.  We recently completed our annual process, using Halogen's multi-rater tool for the first time and we were extremely pleased with the ease of use and end result of the process.  I am sure there will be other issues as we continue to evolve, but we are completely satisfied with Halogen.","customer

They want to keep the feature of inputting the objectives, then using the same form for the Interim review & comments and then use the same form for the Final review & comments.

The one problem we are facing is that we have a process for the beginning of the year - Objective Setting Process. That process has a start and end date of about 3 months. When we hire or someone changes position they need new objectives. We set up a process for those people, however we have learned that when populating data from one process to another (such as from the objective setting process to a review process data can only be pulled from one process, and we have two processes.

our positive productivity. This software provides features which allow the inclusion of third party materials which can then be associated
to employee and task. We love this feature because it allows for continual education at a time where the expertise is most needed. 
An invaluable feature as well is ""flow reporting""  which allows project leads the ability to configure and to customize reporting on project progress. Our only concern is that the mobile software version of their software might benefit from some design improvements to 
make it as interactive and as intuitive as their desktop solution. That observation aside we can say Saba's Talent Space software

Capterra___1190265,Saba TalentSpace,"Halogen is great product but also has great customer service.  I was never on hold for very long and called them often.  They do not have an automated phone service.  You just call the support line and you'll be talking to a real person in just a few minutes. Halogen's 'comment helper' function is easily the best and most innovative feature.  The comment helper makes it really easy for managers to add specific comments to their direct reports without having to come up with comments from scratch.  For example, if you have a 5 point scale, manager's simply drag the slider from a level 5 comment (ie. He/she is always courteous and respectful with customers) to a level one comment (ie. He/she is rarely courteous and respectful with customers).  It takes a little bit to setup, but you don't have to write them.  Admins can just download the comment helpers directly from Halogen and train managers on how to use them.

Halogen also has a multi-rater and a third-party rater function.  This is quite nice for larger organizations.  A multi-rater function gives managers the ability to combine/average out the ratings from multiple managers.  The third-parter rater gives the manager the ability to forward the appraisal to another manager entirely. Halogen is not intuitive.  It's unlike any other software I've come across, so the back end might be confusing if you try and learn it on your own with no training.  For example, administrators might be confused by the fact that there are two locations sets of user information; one called the 'user center' and the other set inside each 'appraisal process'.  The user center information holds user demographic information while the appraisal process set contains user performance information.","managers

SoftwareAdvice___220853,Saba TalentSpace,"Our company was looking to completely change our date performance management process.  No more yearly reviews, but monthly conversations between managers and employees, and quarterly performance appraisals using Cultural, Leadership, and Technical competencies.  Saba was the system that we found to help us accomplish our goals.  The system has been wonderful since implementation.  

All of the learning tools that we use are housed in Saba.  It also interfaces with our HRIS System, Kronos Workforce Management, to have up-to-date employee information (reporting structure, etc.), as well as photos - which has been really helpful.  The Org Charts that Saba has created for us are beautiful, and help managers to easily track employee movement.  Working in the financial industry, many of our employees require various certifications, and Saba allows us to track their progress, expiration dates, and recertification credits.  

The Virtual Classrooms are a fantastic tool that allows us to complete training at our satellite campuses all over the US, and the Social Collaboration aspect helps our company remain inclusive. - Detailed Analytics reporting
- Ease of use
- Social Collaboration (learners can chat with each other, post discussions, hold virtual meetings)
- Gamification - Custom Badges have been really popular at our company - employees WANT to learn to earn badges When implementing Saba, we had been clear about the functionality we needed from the first meeting.  Everything that we needed had been discussed and included in pricing quotes.  Once we received the final contract, there was a fairly large discrepancy, as a feature we needed had not been included in the price quote.  This delayed implementation, but was eventually resolved through our account manager. 

Overall, we have been extremely pleased with this product.","employees

Our agency ran into some issues where there are multiple supervisors per team, and all should have the ability to leave supervisor notes, feedback, etc. for each employee and initially were unable to do so.

The best feature about Saba is that when we merged over from our in-house LMS, there was little work that was required to make sure the system ran videos which were created in WebEx, Ponopto, and Zoom. The reporting capabilities also allowed me to figure out who in my organization was still delinquent on their training, which is valuable as a manager.  The organization I worked for did not have a great history of tagging their data, so when we migrated from our in-house solution to our new solution, it was difficult to search for content unless you knew the exact name of the item you were looking for.

It went well, but required some significant back end administration due to process issues we had built in. This wasn't the fault of the tool, but more due to the development. We really had to go through one iteration to get better at it and learn how it works. The major issue I had with the software was lack of appropriate reporting - there was not a built-in report for simple things I wanted to see, and I have not been able to set up a report for all managers to use to give them data on their employees. Customer support has been great. I wasn't able to pull reports and contacted the team. They walked me through setting up the reports and identified that what I was trying to do would not work in any browser other than explorer. Software works as planned very well, which is what the long development cycle helped with. Reporting still remains an issue. Useful reports are not built into the system and I am not able to set these up for my managers.

The software was completely un-intuitive and lacked BASIC functionalities that should exist for an LMS.  Rep's support team (outsourced from India, seems like) did not know as much as our IT guy knew about it who had been on the job for 3 months. We had very low adoption because of it being clunky and not user-friendly, and not very customize-able. Do not even do an RFP on this because the sales team is AMAZING and will dazzle you.","team

SoftwareAdvice___203625,Saba TalentSpace,"We implemented Saba about a year ago and haven't been very happy with our choice.  I wish they had better Customer Service, a more responsive Support Team and a system that worked as it is designed.  In the past year I have opened 38 support cases and it has taken in upwards of 69 days to resolve a case.  In my opinion, that is unacceptable and should never happen.

Many attempts to provide this exact feedback have fallen on deaf ears.  I have been in contact with their Support Manager and he acknowledges there are issues and constantly assures me they are making changes.  However, I have not seen any improvements.

I share this feedback because I wish there had been this information available when we were inquiring about their system.  I hope this information can help someone avoid making the same mistake we did when we purchased and implemented the Saba system. At this time I am unaware of any pros that would make Saba a better choice than any other LMS vendor in the market. Customer Service,

GetApp___31943,Saba TalentSpace,"We have been using the Halogen system for performance management for a few years. We have a very complex process and I was impressed by how flexible their implementation team was. They worked with us to find workarounds to make the system do what we wanted it to. The support staff and our customer account manager are great as well. I highly recommend it. Convenience, ease of use, great service and 24/7 support Implementation took a little longer than we had anticipated.","implementation

 It allows you to do business with other companies in a personalized way, the technical support is top notch. I would use it again. Saba's ability to relate to other platforms has improved our work and facilitated it is very useful

 One of the few limitations that this platform has is the file loading speed is very slow for the world in which we live, We hope they improve this failure

Capterra___213865,Saba TalentSpace,"Halogen is only good if you have a dedicated staff to manage and administer. It is very heavy on administration and requires a great deal of time. If your company does have a dedicated staff for appraisals, then you don't need Halogen. They promised many things during the sales consultation. After signing up, a box full of large manuals came through. That was the first indication of the challenge using the software. After initial training, there is a lack of support. After repeatedly raising concerns for an SME, they repeatedly asked the same questions. No answers or support were given. Currently, they are not even answering customer emails even though we are a current paying customer with services still under contract. If they had an office in Hong Kong, our company would sue them for misrepresenting their services. The user interface is pleasantly designed.  Set-up takes weeks. Ongoing admin and new appraisals take lots of time. Needs a full time staff to administer. ","customer

SoftwareAdvice___223321,Saba TalentSpace,"Overall, the implementation process with Saba and their customer support team has been excellent. They are timely in responding to requests, answering questions, and progressing in each step of our implementation. Also, they did an excellent job with the product demo and showing us everything that is available for use. I could see us using the system for much more after having used it for a year or two getting comfortable with all of its functionalities. Our employees are very excited about the changes we are able to implement based on the performance management side with Saba allowing employees to stay up to date daily with their performance expectations and goals.  - Customer support
- Modern feel to the system
- Ease of use. - Many of the capabilities of Saba are add-ons to the system that cost extra.","performance
