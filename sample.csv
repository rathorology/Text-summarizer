"{'What do you like best?': 'Advanced work requires advanced work tools, which can also meet complex management agendas, as part of a good business relationship between customers and companies. It is an approach that must be given from the first functions to cover greater expectations and goals of greater scope. SalesForce has the growth capacity that every growing company needs. It is part of the challenge. And SalesForce adds more achievements over time.', 'What do you dislike?': 'CRMs are usually that dynamic option for the sales departments of a company. And they really energize, because it makes all the staff make an extra effort to make the load roll. And also it is necessary who pushes it downhill. In other words, there is a need for technical support personnel to move the business management initiative in the indicated direction. SalesForce is the cart that carries everything, but alone it cannot without horses and coachmen.', 'Recommendations to others considering the product': 'The web base is key in business management work. And with SalesForce this is well regarded as one of the best developed internal tools. It is so to such an extent that SalesForce allows quite freely the customization of the web base. This leads to a more methodical work that aims to achieve a greater impact on the strategies designed with the support in SalesForce. With this advantage, work during management and the new relationship with customers will be simplified.', 'What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?': 'The customer usually looks like a problem and only ceases to be a problem when he makes the respective business contribution to the company in question. Fortunately that is something SalesForce has taken into account since its creation. Hence, it has very complete tools for proper customer service. The client will feel it and with that client feeling good you can have a good link for future and better negotiations.

They take too long to take care of a case and remain restless for a long time. It is something that must be improved to bring the platform successfully.', 'Recommendations to others considering the product': ' SalesForce is a CRM that you will find very versatile, for all types of management that want to apply in your company. This wide versatility allows SalesForce to be used by all the internal departments of a company. In fact, in our company we were able to apply it successfully in the sales, case management, finance, general administration, marketing and data departments. In all these cases there was a good result and the respective work teams carried out their work in a coordinated manner and meeting the planned goals.', 'What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?': 'The solutions you have given me have to do with SalesForce being an all-inclusive CRM. That is, it covers all the details that must be taken into account to keep track of data, such as customer information, sales statistics, commissions, important dates, insurance company data and others of interest. SalesForce customization options also extend to the fact that fields can be customized to track all the information needed for the plan. SalesForce shines for its extensive capabilities.'}","[{'category': 'Sales Force Automation', 'feature_list': [{'title': 'Contact & Account Management', 'description': 'Store and retrieve information associated to customer contacts and accounts.

"{'What do you like best?': 'SalesForce is a way to work more friendly when handling an important group of customers. As we well know, in the competitive world of business and marketing, recruitment and, above all, maintaining a good relationship with them is essential in a commercial activity. But nowadays that type of work escapes from the hand in occasions and makes support an additional help, of management in this case. This is how I see SalesForce, that support in customer management that has made my job easier.', 'What do you dislike?': 'SalesForce is a great help and support, but basically it requires a great investment, and that in business is no longer attractive. It is a medium-term project, in which you have to wait for the response of the clients to know if that great expense had a return. You can take the matter calmly, but if you do not have the resources at hand, if the situation in your business or company is precarious SalesForce could be what you did not expect. Yes, SalesForce is beneficial but money goes with that benefit. You have to invest and wait.', 'Recommendations to others considering the product': 'With the use of SalesForce I can say that with this resource you can make a management of the flow of customers more efficiently and that is what is expected when using an additional tool. You want to make the job easier. Performance is expected to maintain good customer relationships. SalesForce is a very complete and versatile system. In it you have all the necessary tools so that we really do the dedicated customer management we want to do. Actually, customer relationship management becomes lighter. There are many customers who manage to attract and retain themselves, for the good of the business and peace of mind of the work team.', 'What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?': 'SalesForce does a little more than with a traditional Customer Relationship Management program. I say this because SalesForce goes further so that we can build, maintain and above all manage our relationships with customers. In this way we can do we can treat them individually. Knowing customer needs is even more possible with SalesForce. It is valuable information for any business. Entrepreneurs must focus on that so that there is better business growth. But help is needed and a CRM like SalesForce is there to help you.'}","[{'category': 'Sales Force Automation', 'feature_list': [{'title': 'Contact & Account Management', 'description': 'Store and retrieve information associated to customer contacts and accounts.
